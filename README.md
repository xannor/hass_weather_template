This project is no longer supported, I suggest using the built in weather template as this was only a stop-gap for deficient prior versions.

# Weather Template
Weather Template for Home Assisstant

## How it works
This custom component adds a weather template that can be used to merge various weather components for use in a weather card

## Installation

### HACS
Requirements:
 - HACS version 0.9 or higher
 
 Add this repo as a custom repository [integration] in hacs and install
 
### Manual ###
copy the entire weather_template folder in custom_components into the config/custom_components folder on your installation, reboot, and add template to your configuration yaml

## Usage
[see info](info.md)
